    "body": "The claim that Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir moved to stop an investigation into soldiers who killed two unarmed Palestinians in Jenin, despite UN demands for a full probe, is currently unsubstantiated. While Minister Ben-Gvir is known for his controversial stance on security matters, and the UN frequently calls for investigations into such incidents, there are no credible reports from official Israeli government sources, judicial bodies, the UN itself, or major international news agencies confirming that Ben-Gvir specifically intervened to halt an investigation into this particular event. Without verifiable evidence from reliable sources, the claim of his direct intervention to stop an investigation remains unproven.",
