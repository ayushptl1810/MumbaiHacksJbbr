    "body": "The assertion that a post suggests expelling '6 crore' (60 million) Muslims from India and then processing the entry of non-Rohingya Bangladeshis is false. There is no credible evidence, official government policy, or substantiated proposal from any authoritative source in India to support such a large-scale expulsion or a discriminatory entry process as described. While India's immigration policies and issues concerning migrants from Bangladesh and Rohingya refugees are subjects of public discussion, no official plan or widespread advocacy for the extreme measures outlined in the claim has been confirmed. The provided sources discuss general immigration verification and Rohingya context, but do not support this specific, extreme claim.",
    "summary": "The claim about expelling 60 million Muslims from India and specific Bangladeshi entry procedures is false and lacks any official backing."

However, none of these snippets suggest or support the claim of expelling '6 crore Muslims' from India or a policy for 'processing the entry of non-Rohingya Bangladeshis.' The claim's specific figures and religious targeting are not substantiated by the evidence, which focuses on immigration status rather than religious affiliation for mass expulsion.",
