However, the provided sources offer no evidence to corroborate this specific financial expenditure or project. One source details raids on an intel executive's residences, while the other discusses a Hyundai raid and technical skills. Both are entirely unrelated to the FBI, Jeffrey Epstein files, or redaction costs. Therefore, the claim about the FBI's alleged $1 million spending on Epstein file redactions is currently unsubstantiated by the given information.",
