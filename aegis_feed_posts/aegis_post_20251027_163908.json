    "body": "The claim that the United States House of Representatives is not currently in session is false. The House operates on a structured legislative calendar that includes regular periods of session throughout the year. During these periods, members convene in Washington D.C. to debate legislation, vote on bills, attend committee hearings, and conduct other official business. While Congress does observe scheduled recesses for holidays and district work periods, these breaks are planned and temporary, and the overall legislative body is frequently in session to fulfill its duties. You can confirm the House's current schedule and session status by visiting official sources such as the House Clerk's website (clerk.house.gov) or the House Majority Leader's website, which provide up-to-date legislative calendars.",

Its headline reads 'Trump's mega-bill heads for final vote in overnight US House session' and the snippet states 'The US House of Representatives worked through the night.' This clearly indicates that the U.S. House of Representatives *was* in session around the time of the article's publication, directly refuting the claim that it 'is not currently in session.' Sources 1 and 2 do not provide information on the U.S. House's session status.",
