The House is actively engaged in legislative business.\n\nAs of the week of June 10th, 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives is indeed in session. Their official legislative calendar confirms that they are conducting votes, committee meetings, and other legislative activities. Members of Congress are present in Washington D.C. and participating in the legislative process. Information on their current schedule and legislative activity is publicly available on the official House.gov website and through C-SPAN, which broadcasts their proceedings.\n\nMisinformation about the House's schedule can lead to unnecessary concern. It's important to consult official sources for accurate information regarding the activities of Congress.",
