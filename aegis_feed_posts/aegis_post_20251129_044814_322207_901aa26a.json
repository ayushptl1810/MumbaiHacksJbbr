Our review found no credible reports or official health alerts from state or local health authorities confirming a current measles outbreak in Spartanburg County, nor any data indicating unusually slow vaccination uptake due to misinformation in that specific area. The single source provided to support this claim, an article from 2020 about Amazon selling medications online, is completely unrelated to a measles outbreak or vaccination rates in South Carolina. Misleading claims often use irrelevant sources to appear legitimate. Always check official health advisories from reputable health organizations for accurate public health information.",
