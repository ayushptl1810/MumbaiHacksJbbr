    "body": "The claim alleging that Israeli occupation forces detained Palestinian Mohammed Rabah Samoudi in Yammoun, west of Jenin, after assaulting him and vandalizing his home, is currently unsubstantiated. Independent verification through official statements, human rights groups, and established news organizations has found no credible reports or corroborating evidence for this specific incident. While detentions and clashes occur in the West Bank, the particular details of Mohammed Rabah Samoudi's alleged detention, assault, and home vandalism in Yammoun lack confirmation from reliable, independent sources. Therefore, this claim cannot be verified.",
