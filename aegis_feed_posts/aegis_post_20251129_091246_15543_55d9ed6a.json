    "body": "The claim that women in Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp continue to bear the burden of survival after an Israeli massacre on November 18, 2025, is demonstrably false. The primary reason for its falsity is the specified date: November 18, 2025. This date is in the future, making it impossible for an event to have already occurred and for its aftermath to be ongoing. There are no credible reports, official warnings, or prophetic statements from any recognized authority or news organization indicating that such a 'massacre' is planned or has been predicted for this future date. This claim appears to be entirely fabricated or based on a significant factual error regarding the timeline of events.",
