The provided sources, however, do not corroborate this particular event, names, or specific circumstances. One article discusses broader concerns about children being targeted in the Gaza war, without detailing this specific incident. The second source reports on a Palestinian gunman at an Israeli military checkpoint, which is a different event entirely. While tragic casualties regrettably occur in conflict zones, this specific allegation, including the individuals named and the precise scenario, is not supported by the information provided.",

Source 3 states, 'the Israeli army and police said that they were reviewing an incident in which two Palestinian men were shot and killed,' confirming an incident of two Palestinians killed and a review, but again, no specific names or details about them exiting a building with hands raised. The key specific details in the claim are missing from the sources.",
