    "body": "The claim broadly states that citizens, despite paying high taxes across various categories, still face severe personal and financial hardship due to poor infrastructure and inadequate social safety nets. While this situation may resonate with individuals in various regions, the claim as a universal or generally applicable statement is unsubstantiated. Our verification indicates the claim is 'uncertain' and 'false' in its broad application. The provided sources, which include IMF staff reports and economic surveys, specifically focus on *Kenya*. These documents detail economic conditions, public finance, and infrastructure challenges within that country, suggesting the claim might hold true in that specific context. However, without evidence applying this sweeping statement to a wider global or generalized context, its universality cannot be confirmed.",
