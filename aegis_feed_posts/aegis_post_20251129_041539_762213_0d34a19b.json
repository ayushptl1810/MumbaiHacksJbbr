    "body": "Reports circulating online claim the FBI is dedicating nearly $1 million specifically to redact mentions of Donald Trump from Jeffrey Epstein's files. However, evidence does not support this assertion. While there has been significant public and political interest in the release of Epstein's documents, and calls for transparency have grown, particularly concerning high-profile individuals, there is no credible information indicating the FBI is spending such an amount with this specific directive. News reports confirm the ongoing push for the release of these files and discussions around their content, but they do not mention any FBI budget allocation for redacting specific names like Donald Trump. The focus of recent news has been on the legal processes and demands for the overall release of the documents, not on specific redaction costs or targets.",

Source 2 mentions an exchange where Epstein said he could 'take down' Trump was *released* along with files. 4. Source 3 indicates Trump urged lawmakers to vote to *release* the files. 5.
