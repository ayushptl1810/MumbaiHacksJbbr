    "body": "The claim highlighting a Guru's supreme importance, even 'above God,' due to their role in connecting to the divine presents a nuanced interpretation of spiritual traditions. In many Hindu and other dharmic traditions, the Guru is indeed held in extremely high reverence, often seen as a manifestation of the divine or the essential guide to spiritual realization. Expressions like 'Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat Parambrahma' signify this profound respect. However, the literal interpretation of placing a Guru 'above God' can be an oversimplification. While the Guru is indispensable for showing the path to the divine, they are generally considered the *means* to God, not literally superior to the ultimate divine principle itself. The claim is therefore 'mixed,' as it captures the spirit of immense reverence but might misinterpret the precise hierarchical position in a literal sense.",
    "summary": "While Gurus are deeply revered as guides to the divine, the literal claim of placing them 'above God' is an oversimplification of complex spiritual traditions."
