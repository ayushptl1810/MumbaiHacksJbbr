Without access to the original post, the specific hashtag, or any evidence of the campaign's initiation or progress, it is impossible to verify if such a call to action actually exists, what its exact content was, or whether the stated goal was ever pursued or achieved. Such claims pertain to ephemeral online activity that requires direct observation or official reporting to be substantiated. The provided sources are general news articles unrelated to social media campaigns about 'Fourth Grade.'",
