    "body": "A claim suggests the FBI has spent nearly $1 million on overtime to redact Jeffrey Epstein's files, specifically flagging mentions of Trump, potentially withholding information from the public. Our verification finds this claim to be unsubstantiated. The key reason for this is that the sources provided to support the claim are dated July and August 2025. As these dates are in the future, the articles do not currently exist and therefore cannot provide any factual basis for the alleged FBI spending or redaction activities. Without current and verifiable information, the assertion about FBI expenditures and actions regarding the Epstein files, particularly concerning mentions of Donald Trump, cannot be confirmed as true.",
    "summary": "Claims of the FBI spending $1 million on Epstein file redactions and flagging Trump mentions are unverified, as the provided sources are future-dated and currently non-existent.",
