    "body": "The claim states that South Carolina is experiencing a measles outbreak, with vaccination efforts hampered by misinformation. While measles cases are indeed rising in the U.S. generally, and misinformation is a significant challenge, the specific geographical detail of this claim is incorrect based on the provided evidence. One source broadly discusses rising measles cases in the U.S. and misinformation's role. Crucially, the second source explicitly identifies *Texas* as an epicenter of a measles outbreak, noting a visit by RFK Jr. after a child died there. There is no information in either source to support a measles outbreak specifically in South Carolina.",
    "summary": "The claim of a measles outbreak in South Carolina is false; provided sources indicate an outbreak in Texas."
