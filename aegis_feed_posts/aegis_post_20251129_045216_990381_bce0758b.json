    "body": "The claim suggesting a future Melania Trump White House Christmas would 'restore traditional and classy décor,' contrasting with current decorations described as 'drag-queen-fairy-land theatrics,' is false. This statement is highly speculative and based on subjective opinion rather than verifiable fact. It refers to a hypothetical future event and uses loaded, subjective language to describe both past and present décor choices. Discussions about future White House decorations are purely speculative and cannot be confirmed or denied as factual claims. Furthermore, the sources provided alongside this claim are completely irrelevant, addressing coronavirus questions and a past Trump-Zelensky meeting, offering no support for the decorative claims. Such statements reflect personal preferences rather than an objective reality.",
    "summary": "The claim about hypothetical future White House Christmas décor under Melania Trump is false, as it's speculative, opinion-based, and lacks any factual basis.",
