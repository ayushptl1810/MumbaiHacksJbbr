    "body": "The claims made by a user regarding harassment from a Shankarmutt president, an accusation of a temple 'stealing their energy,' and the rejection of various deities are deeply personal and rooted in subjective spiritual experiences and beliefs. These assertions cannot be objectively verified or disproven through factual evidence or external investigation. Concepts such as 'energy theft' are not empirically measurable, and allegations of harassment in this context would require specific, actionable evidence to be addressed. The provided sources, discussing unrelated news about religious figures and associations, do not offer any information relevant to substantiating or refuting these specific personal claims.",
    "summary": "Personal claims of harassment from a religious figure and 'energy theft' from a temple are subjective and lack factual basis for verification."
