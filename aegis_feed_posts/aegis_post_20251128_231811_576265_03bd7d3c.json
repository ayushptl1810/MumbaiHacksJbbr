    "body": "The claim asserts that \"Trump's FBI\" spent nearly $1 million on a \"special redaction project\" for Jeffrey Epstein files when their release was anticipated. While it is true that Epstein files were released and some mentioned Trump (as confirmed by the provided sources), neither article offers any evidence to support the specific claim of the FBI spending nearly $1 million on a *special redaction project*. One source discusses a White House briefing on newly released Epstein emails referencing Trump, and the other notes the Attorney General alerted Trump about his name appearing in the files. These sources confirm the existence of the files and Trump's references but provide no details on FBI spending or specific redaction project costs. Therefore, the financial and project-specific aspects of this claim are unsubstantiated.",
