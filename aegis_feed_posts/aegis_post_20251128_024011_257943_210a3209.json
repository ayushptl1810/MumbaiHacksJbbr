    "body": "The assertion that 'spiritual practices in educational institutions are essential to empower youth, build resilience, and enhance intuitive abilities for the AI era' is an opinion and a philosophical stance rather than a universally established fact. While many individuals find personal benefits in spiritual practices, and some studies suggest positive correlations between mindfulness or well-being practices and certain outcomes, the claim that these practices are 'essential' for specific outcomes, particularly in the context of the 'AI era,' is a broad generalization lacking definitive scientific or educational consensus. There is no empirical evidence to deem them 'essential' across all educational contexts or for these specific future-oriented benefits. The provided sources are irrelevant to this claim.",
    "summary": "The claim that spiritual practices are 'essential' in education for youth empowerment and AI readiness is an unproven opinion, not a fact."
