However, the provided sources do not support this specific allegation. One article discusses federal worker payouts and executive orders, while the other covers criticism regarding an FBI nominee's qualifications. Neither of these sources mentions a \"D.C. shooter,\" vetting status, or any alleged lies by the Trump administration on such a matter. Without relevant evidence, this specific claim remains unsubstantiated.",
