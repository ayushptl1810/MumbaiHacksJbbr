    "heading": "Rajasthan Job Policy: A Recommendation, Not a Verifiable Fact",
    "body": "The statement suggesting that \"Rajasthan should increase the number of permanent 4th Grade appointments to fill vacant positions across all government departments\" is not a factual claim that can be verified as true or false. Instead, it represents a policy recommendation or an opinion regarding government employment strategy in Rajasthan. As such, it falls outside the scope of typical fact-checking, which assesses the truthfulness of statements of fact. The verdict of 'error' indicates that the claim cannot be fact-checked in a conventional sense because it expresses a viewpoint or proposal rather than a verifiable event or condition. Debating the merits of this recommendation requires policy discussion, not factual confirmation.",
    "summary": "The statement about Rajasthan increasing 4th Grade appointments is a policy recommendation, not a factual claim that can be verified as true or false."
