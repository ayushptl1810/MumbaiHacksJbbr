    "body": "The claim of a measles outbreak in South Carolina demonstrating the negative impact of vaccine misinformation on public health is false. As of current public health records, there has not been a widely reported measles outbreak in South Carolina that aligns with the scenario described. While vaccine misinformation is a known public health challenge globally and measles cases can occur, this specific claim about an outbreak in South Carolina directly linked to widespread misinformation is inaccurate. Furthermore, the provided sources, which detail COVID-19 news, vaccine information, and the Omicron variant, are completely unrelated to measles or any specific outbreak in South Carolina, offering no factual basis for the claim.",

Source 3 discusses Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s statements on autism, which may be related to vaccine misinformation generally, but does not mention any outbreak or South Carolina.
