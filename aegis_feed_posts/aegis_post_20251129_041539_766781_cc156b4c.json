    "body": "The claim asserts that vaccine misinformation is fueling a measles outbreak in South Carolina by discouraging vaccination. However, there is no verified information supporting a measles outbreak specifically in South Carolina caused by vaccine misinformation. While measles outbreaks have occurred in various regions, often linked to vaccine hesitancy or refusal, the provided sources discuss outbreaks in other areas, such as those involving Mennonite communities and West Texans who prioritize 'medical freedom' over vaccine mandates. These sources highlight complex reasons behind vaccination choices, which may or may not be solely attributed to 'misinformation.' Therefore, the specific connection between vaccine misinformation and a measles outbreak in South Carolina, as claimed, lacks substantiation in available reports.",

However, Source 1 does not specify the location of the measles outbreak. 5. Source 2 explicitly states a measles outbreak on 'the south plains of *Texas*,' not South Carolina. 6.
