    "body": "The claim describes a flyover crack repair method as being so poor that it constitutes an 'international embarrassment,' worse than expected even in developing nations. Our verification finds this claim to be unsubstantiated. The verdict is 'uncertain' and 'false,' meaning there is no evidence to support this serious allegation. Crucially, the claim fails to specify *which* flyover is being discussed or its geographical location, making any attempt to verify the repair method impossible. Additionally, the sources provided are entirely irrelevant: one is an opinion piece on an author, and the other is a sports article. Neither offers any information pertinent to infrastructure, engineering, or flyover repairs. Without specific details and credible, relevant sources, this generalized criticism of a flyover repair cannot be confirmed.",
