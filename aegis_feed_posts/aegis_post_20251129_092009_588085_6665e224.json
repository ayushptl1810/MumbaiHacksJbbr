As of current public health advisories from official sources like the CDC and the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), there is no widespread or declared measles outbreak currently ongoing in South Carolina. While measles outbreaks can indeed be linked to declining vaccination rates fueled by misinformation, this specific claim about South Carolina lacks factual basis. Always verify health-related claims with official public health organizations.",
