    "body": "The claim circulating that 'veteran AIADMK leader K.A. Sengottaiyan [has resigned] to join Vijay's TVK' is false. K.A. Sengottaiyan, a prominent and seasoned leader of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) party in Tamil Nadu, has not resigned from his party. There have been no credible reports from official sources, major news outlets, or K.A. Sengottaiyan himself indicating any such move. As of current information, he remains an active and influential leader within the AIADMK. While actor Vijay recently launched his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), the specific claim about Sengottaiyan joining it is a baseless rumor, likely spread through social media. Significant political shifts involving veteran leaders of this stature are always widely reported and officially confirmed, which is not the case here.",
