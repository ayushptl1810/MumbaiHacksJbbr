    "body": "The claim asserts a measles outbreak in South Carolina with over 50 cases, linking it to vaccine misinformation and low vaccination rates. However, our verification reveals that the specific details of this claim are false. While vaccine misinformation is a known public health concern, the primary source cited (PBS) actually reports on a measles outbreak in *West Texas*, where cases have risen to 90, not South Carolina with over 50 cases. The other source provides general information about measles boosters. Therefore, the geographical location and case numbers specified in the claim are incorrect. It is important to distinguish between general health concerns and specific, verifiable outbreak details.",
