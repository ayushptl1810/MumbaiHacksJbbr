Therefore, it is not \"finally out\" as a *new* release. Furthermore, the web series was released exclusively on the *Play Prime* streaming platform, not Amazon and MX Player as incorrectly stated. Details about college politics, drama, and emotions describe the content but are secondary to the primary inaccuracies regarding release timing and platforms.",
