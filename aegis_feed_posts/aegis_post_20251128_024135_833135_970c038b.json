    "body": "The claim that Indian pacer Shikha Pandey was acquired by UP Warriorz for Rs 2.40 crore in a WPL 2026 Mega Auction is false. \n\n**Here's why:**\n\n1.  **Incorrect Team and Price:** Shikha Pandey was indeed a sought-after player in the Women's Premier League (WPL) auction. However, she was purchased by **Delhi Capitals**, not UP Warriorz, for **Rs 60 lakh** during the inaugural WPL auction in February 2023. She has been an integral part of the Delhi Capitals squad since then.\n2.  **Incorrect Auction Year:** There has been no 'WPL 2026 Mega Auction'. The WPL, which commenced in 2023, conducts annual auctions or trading windows closer to each season. A 'Mega Auction' typically refers to a large-scale event where most players re-enter the pool, which has not happened for WPL 2026, a season still two years away.\n\nTherefore, all key details in the claim regarding the team, acquisition price, and auction year are incorrect.",
    "summary": "The claim about Shikha Pandey being bought by UP Warriorz for Rs 2.40 crore in a WPL 2026 Mega Auction is false; she plays for Delhi Capitals, was bought for Rs 60 lakh in the WPL 2023 auction, and no WPL 2026 Mega Auction has occurred."
