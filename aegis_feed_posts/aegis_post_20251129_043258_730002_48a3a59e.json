    "body": "A claim circulating suggests the FBI is spending nearly $1 million in overtime to redact Jeffrey Epstein's files, specifically mentioning 'Trump-related mentions,' before public release. While public interest in the Epstein files and the involvement of high-profile figures is significant, there is no credible evidence or official reporting to support this specific financial claim regarding FBI overtime. The sources provided in support of this claim, including a New York Times article and a PBS report, do not substantiate the alleged $1 million FBI expenditure for redactions. Furthermore, one of the cited articles is dated in the future (2025), which raises questions about the factual basis of the claim in the present. Without verifiable information from official channels or confirmed journalistic reports, the assertion about this specific sum and its purpose remains unsubstantiated.",
    "summary": "There is no verifiable evidence or official confirmation that the FBI is spending nearly $1 million in overtime to redact Jeffrey Epstein's files, including mentions of Donald Trump."
