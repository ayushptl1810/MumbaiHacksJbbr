Based on the provided information, there is no evidence to verify the existence or content of such a post. The sources given, 'We answer to nobody': duo Bob Vylan on humility, hell-raising – and...' and ''That's it? It's over? I was 30. What a brutal business': pop stars on...', discuss specific musical duos (like Bob Vylan) and general experiences of pop stars.

Without further evidence, it's not possible to confirm that such a post exists or that it seeks support for an *unspecified* duo.",

This names a specific duo, contradicting 'unspecified', but more importantly, this is a news article, not 'the post' itself.\n3. Source 2 (The Guardian) discusses pop stars and their careers, mentioning individuals like Bob Geldof and Robbie Williams, not a duo being supported by a post.\n4. Source 3 (NPR) discusses 'billy woods' and his solo album, again not 'the post' or a duo.\n5. None of the provided sources are 'the post' in question, nor do they describe the content or nature of such a post. Without access to 'the post' or any information describing it, the claim cannot be verified or refuted using the provided sources.",
