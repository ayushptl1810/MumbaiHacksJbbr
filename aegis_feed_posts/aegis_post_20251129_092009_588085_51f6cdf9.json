    "body": "A claim suggests the FBI is deliberately spending significant money to redact Jeffrey Epstein files, specifically noting mentions of Donald Trump, and withholding information from public view. While redactions are a standard and necessary part of releasing sensitive legal documents to protect privacy (e.g., minors' identities) or ongoing investigations, there is no credible evidence to support the assertion that the FBI is specifically targeting 'Trump mentions' for removal with malicious intent, or that they are abnormally or improperly keeping information from public view in this context. The release of Epstein-related documents has primarily been driven by court orders in civil cases, with redactions handled according to legal standards and judicial oversight. The claim of the FBI's specific involvement in *maliciously* redacting Trump mentions is unsubstantiated.",
