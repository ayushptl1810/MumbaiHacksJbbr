    "body": "A claim suggests that Dubai's roads are notably dust-free despite the city's desert surroundings. Our verification process found this claim to be unsubstantiated. The verdict is classified as 'uncertain' and 'false,' indicating a lack of credible information to support this assertion. Furthermore, the sources provided as evidence are completely irrelevant to Dubai: one discusses China's economic initiatives in Kazakhstan, and the other details land disputes in Tanzania. These sources offer no information concerning infrastructure, dust management, or road conditions in Dubai. Without any supporting evidence or relevant sources, the claim about Dubai's dust-free roads cannot be confirmed as factual.",
    "summary": "The claim about Dubai's roads being notably dust-free despite its desert environment is unverified, with no supporting evidence from the provided irrelevant sources.",
