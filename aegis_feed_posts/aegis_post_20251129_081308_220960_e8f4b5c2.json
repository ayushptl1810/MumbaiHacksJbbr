    "body": "The claim that Donald Trump has pledged to pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez, a convicted drug trafficker, and that this has sparked widespread outrage, is unsupported by any credible public statements or reports. While Juan Orlando Hernandez was indeed convicted of drug trafficking in a U.S. court in March 2024, there is no public record of Donald Trump making any such commitment to pardon him. The provided sources, which discuss news outlets' stance on a Pentagon document and American opinions on insurance profits, are completely irrelevant to the claim and offer no substantiation whatsoever.",

This verifies the first part of the claim (Trump's pledge to pardon Hernandez, a convicted drug trafficker). However, the crucial second part of the claim, 'has sparked widespread outrage,' is not mentioned or evidenced in any of the provided sources.
