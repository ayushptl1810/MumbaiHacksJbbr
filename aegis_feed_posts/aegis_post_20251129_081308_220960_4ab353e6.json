    "body": "The claim states that 'This post is a direct question asking for individuals who regret supporting Donald Trump to share their experiences.' This statement is false. The text you are currently reading (the claim itself) is a declarative statement, not a direct question seeking experiences. If 'This post' refers to an external, unspecified post, the provided sources do not describe such content. The sources cited, concerning Christians' views on Trump and sexual assault survivors, are entirely unrelated to the nature or content of a post asking for regrets about supporting Donald Trump. Therefore, the claim misrepresents the format and purpose of 'This post.'",
