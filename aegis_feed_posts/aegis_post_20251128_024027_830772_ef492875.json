    "body": "The assertion that there's an organized effort to create 70,000 social media posts about 'Fourth Grade' using a specific hashtag is not supported by any evidence. Despite checks, no information has surfaced to substantiate such a campaign. The sources cited for this claim are entirely unrelated, referring to news about the Trump administration and the Uvalde shooting, which have no bearing on social media initiatives. The 'uncertain' verdict indicates that while the claim hasn't been definitively disproven, it also lacks any basis in fact. Public information does not corroborate the existence of this widespread call to action.",
    "summary": "The claim about a call for 70,000 'Fourth Grade' posts via a specific hashtag lacks any supporting evidence or relevant sources."
