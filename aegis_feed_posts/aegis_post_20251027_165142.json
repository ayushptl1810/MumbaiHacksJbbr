As of the current legislative calendar, the House of Representatives is actively convening to conduct its legislative duties. This includes holding debates, voting on bills, conducting committee meetings, and overseeing various government functions. While the House does observe scheduled recesses throughout the year, these are part of its regular calendar, and it remains an active, functioning body. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on the House's schedule, including session dates and legislative activity, official sources like the House of Representatives' own website (house.gov) should be consulted.",
