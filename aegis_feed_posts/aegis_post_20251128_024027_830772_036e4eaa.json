    "body": "A social media claim circulating suggests there's a specific call to generate 70,000 posts related to 'Fourth Grade' using a particular hashtag. However, our investigation found no verifiable evidence to support this claim. The provided sources, which reference unrelated New York Times articles about Trump administration funding and the Uvalde school shooting, offer no information pertaining to social media trends or campaigns. Therefore, without any credible sources or identifiable posts initiating such a call, the claim remains unconfirmed. When a claim is labeled 'uncertain' despite being 'verified false,' it means that while it cannot be confirmed as true, there isn't definitive proof of its falsehood either, only a complete lack of supporting evidence.",
