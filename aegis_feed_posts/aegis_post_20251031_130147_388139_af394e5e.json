    "body": "A claim states that Joe Rogan asserted nicotine itself is not harmful, only its method of delivery. However, the provided sources do not verify that Joe Rogan made this specific claim. One source is a general fact-check of a different Rogan interview, and the other, dated in the future (August 2025), discusses general nicotine risks rather than a specific Rogan statement. Scientific consensus widely refutes the idea that nicotine is harmless. Nicotine is a highly addictive chemical that can have several adverse effects on the body, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, and negative impacts on adolescent brain development. While the delivery methods like smoking combustible cigarettes add significantly more severe health risks due to other harmful chemicals, nicotine itself is far from benign.",
    "summary": "Joe Rogan's alleged claim about nicotine being harmless is unverified by provided sources, and scientific evidence confirms nicotine itself is harmful and addictive."

However, the source does not contain a direct quote or explicit statement from Rogan matching the precise wording of the claim regarding nicotine's harmlessness and attributing harm solely to the delivery method. Sources 2 and 3 are unrelated to Rogan's views on nicotine.",
