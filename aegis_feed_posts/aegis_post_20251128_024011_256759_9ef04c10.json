    "body": "The user's personal claim about a relative, identified as a BJP/RSS supporter, 'stealing their horoscope yogas' is inherently unverifiable. This assertion falls squarely within the realm of personal belief, subjective experience, and astrological or spiritual interpretation, rather than a fact that can be confirmed or disproven by external evidence. Concepts like 'horoscope yogas' being stolen are not tangible events measurable by conventional means, and therefore cannot be fact-checked against objective sources. The provided sources, which are unrelated news sitemaps and political articles, offer no relevant information to corroborate or refute such a claim.",
    "summary": "A personal claim about 'stolen horoscope yogas' based on subjective belief cannot be factually verified or debunked by external evidence."
