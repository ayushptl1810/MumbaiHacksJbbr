    "body": "The claim describes an Israeli army incursion into Beit Jinn, Syria, alleging resistance from local residents, resulting in the deaths of a dozen Syrians and injuries to Israeli soldiers. While there have been reports of Israeli military operations and raids in Syria, including instances leading to Syrian casualties, the specific details of this claim lack full corroboration. Available news reports confirm Israeli military actions in southern Syria resulting in fatalities, with one source mentioning 'at least 13' killed in a raid. However, these reports do not specifically name 'Beit Jinn' as the location, nor do they detail 'resistance from local residents' or 'injuries to Israeli soldiers' during such an incursion. The discrepancies in specific location, the nature of resistance, and casualties on the Israeli side mean that the claim as a whole is not fully supported by the available verified information.",
    "summary": "Specific details about an Israeli incursion in Beit Jinn, Syria, including local resistance and injuries to Israeli soldiers, are unconfirmed despite reports of Israeli military action in the region."
