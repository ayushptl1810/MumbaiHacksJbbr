    "body": "Claims circulating that Donald Trump has pledged to pardon Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former Honduran president convicted of drug trafficking, are unfounded. There is no credible evidence from reputable news organizations or official statements to support such a promise from Donald Trump. The sources provided alongside this claim are entirely unrelated, discussing topics like Capitol riot participants and asylum claim decisions, offering no relevance or support for the alleged pardon pledge. Juan Orlando Hernandez was indeed convicted in a U.S. court, but reports of a pardon pledge from Trump lack any verifiable basis.",

This verifies the pledge and Hernandez's conviction status. However, neither source offers any evidence or mention of public or significant outrage provoked by this pledge. Source 3 is irrelevant to this specific claim. Therefore, while parts of the claim are true, the full claim including the 'significant outrage' aspect cannot be fully verified with the provided information.",
