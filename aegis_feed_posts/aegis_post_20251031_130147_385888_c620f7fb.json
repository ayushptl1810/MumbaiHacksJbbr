    "body": "A claim circulating that a memorial service for Charlie Kirk was criticized as 'cult-like' is false. Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA, is alive and well. Since no memorial service has taken place for him, any criticism or observation of such an event is entirely unfounded. The provided sources do not support the existence of a memorial service for Charlie Kirk, nor do they contain any criticism of such an event. In fact, one source is dated in the future (September 2025), further indicating that the entire premise of the claim is speculative or fabricated.",
    "summary": "The claim is false because Charlie Kirk is alive and, therefore, no memorial service has occurred to be criticized."
