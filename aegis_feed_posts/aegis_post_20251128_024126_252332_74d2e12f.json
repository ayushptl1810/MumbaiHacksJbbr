    "body": "This claim contains multiple significant factual errors regarding the Women's Premier League (WPL) auctions. Firstly, established players Alyssa Healy and Alana King were *not* unsold; Healy captains UP Warriorz, and King played for RCB. Secondly, Meg Lanning, a prominent Australian captain, was bought by *Delhi Capitals* in the WPL 2023 auction for INR 1.1 Crore, not UP Warriorz for AU$325,700, and she was already the highest-earning Australian then. The claim falsely attributes actual events and player statuses while mixing in potentially obscure names (Lucy Hamilton, Milly Illingworth) to create a misleading narrative, all under the guise of an unspecified, likely non-existent, WPL auction event.",
    "summary": "The claim falsely states that Alyssa Healy and Alana King went unsold, misrepresents Meg Lanning's team and price, and contains multiple inaccuracies regarding WPL player selections."
