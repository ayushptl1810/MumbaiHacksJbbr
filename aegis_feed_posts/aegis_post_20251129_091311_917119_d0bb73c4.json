    "body": "The claim that 'Dubai's roads are completely free of dust despite being surrounded by desert' is false. While Dubai is renowned for its modern infrastructure and invests significantly in maintaining urban cleanliness, achieving a state of 'completely free' of dust in a desert environment is practically impossible. Dubai is situated in an arid desert region, making it inherently susceptible to wind-blown sand and dust from its natural surroundings. Sandstorms and general atmospheric dust are common occurrences, inevitably leading to dust accumulation on roads and public spaces. Authorities deploy extensive cleaning efforts, including street sweeping and washing, but these are ongoing battles to manage dust, not a permanent eradication. To claim total freedom from dust contradicts the fundamental realities of its geographical location and climate.",
