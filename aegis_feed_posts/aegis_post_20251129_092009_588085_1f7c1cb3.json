    "body": "A claim states that Donald Trump announced his intention to pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was recently sentenced for drug trafficking in the United States. This claim is false. There have been no credible reports from Donald Trump, his campaign, or any major news outlets indicating such an announcement. Presidential pardons are significant public actions, and any such declaration would be widely covered and officially documented. Juan Orlando Hernández was indeed convicted and sentenced in the U.S., but there is no evidence of Trump making any statement about a pardon for him.",
