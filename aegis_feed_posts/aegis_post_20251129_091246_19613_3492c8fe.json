    "body": "The claim that an armed unit from the Israeli army carried out an incursion into Beit Jinn, Syria, leading to the killing of a dozen Syrians and injuries to Israeli soldiers, is unverified. Similar to a related claim, comprehensive checks of official statements from relevant governments, reports from international news agencies, and independent monitoring organizations have found no credible information or corroborating evidence to support this specific military operation. While Israel conducts operations in Syrian territory, the detailed account of an incursion into Beit Jinn resulting in these particular casualties on both sides has not been substantiated by reliable, independent sources. Therefore, this claim remains unproven.",
