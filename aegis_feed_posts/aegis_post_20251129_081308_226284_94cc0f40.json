    "body": "The claim that the FBI is spending nearly $1 million to redact Jeffrey Epstein's files, specifically flagging mentions of Donald Trump to keep information hidden, is not supported by evidence. While Jeffrey Epstein's files have been the subject of public interest and court-ordered releases, and Donald Trump's name has appeared in some released documents, there is no credible reporting of the FBI allocating nearly $1 million for specific redactions aimed at concealing information related to Trump. Redactions in legal documents are standard practice to protect privacy, ongoing investigations, or sensitive details, and are not inherently meant to hide specific individuals' involvement beyond legal necessity. The provided sources discuss the Senate's agreement to release Epstein files and Trump's name appearing in *newly released* files, which contradicts the idea of information being hidden and offers no support for the alleged spending or intent.",
