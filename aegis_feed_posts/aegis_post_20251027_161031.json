    "body": "A widely circulated video claiming to show former President Donald Trump dancing energetically in Malaysia, leading to questions about his health, is false. The individual featured in the footage is *not* Donald Trump.\n\nThe video actually depicts Indonesian businessman and politician Didit Hediprasetyo, the son of former Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto. The footage was taken at Hediprasetyo's own wedding in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2013 – over a decade ago. While the man in the video shares a passing resemblance to Donald Trump, especially from certain angles, careful examination and readily available information confirm his true identity.\n\nMisinformation often spreads through misidentification, and this is a clear example of a video being taken out of context and falsely attributed. Therefore, any concerns or questions raised about Donald Trump's health based on this particular video are unfounded, as he is not the person shown. Always verify the source and context of viral content before sharing or drawing conclusions.",
    "summary": "A viral video claiming to show Donald Trump dancing in Malaysia, prompting health concerns, is false; the footage is actually from 2013 and features Indonesian politician Didit Hediprasetyo dancing at his wedding in Jakarta."
