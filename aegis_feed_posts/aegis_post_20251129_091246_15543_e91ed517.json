    "body": "The assertion that two Palestinian solidarity activists were abducted by Israeli settlers and occupation forces in Tuwani, West Bank, is not supported by available evidence. Comprehensive checks of official statements, human rights reports, and major news organizations covering events in the West Bank found no credible accounts or independent verification of such an abduction. While tensions and incidents involving settlers and security forces in the West Bank are reported, this particular claim, with its specific details of an abduction in Tuwani, lacks any corroborating information from reliable sources. Therefore, it remains an unverified claim.",
