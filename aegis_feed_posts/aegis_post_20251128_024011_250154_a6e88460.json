Despite general interest and discussions surrounding freedom of speech for medical professionals and geopolitical events, no credible or official reports from the NHS, medical regulatory bodies, or reputable news outlets have verified this specific incident of a doctor being suspended for the reasons stated. General news sources about Palestine or London do not contain information confirming this particular suspension.",

        "reasoning": "All three sources from The Guardian confirm that an 'NHS doctor was suspended over alleged antisemitic social media posts.' This verifies the core event of an NHS doctor's suspension due to social media activity. However, the claim's specific reason, 'pro-Palestine social media posts,' differs from the sources' description of 'alleged antisemitic social media posts.' While pro-Palestine posts can sometimes be controversially labeled antisemitic, the sources do not explicitly link the suspension *solely* to 'pro-Palestine' content. Furthermore, the claim's detail of a '15 months' suspension is not mentioned in any of the provided snippets.",
