    "body": "The assertion that a post presents the complete squad of UP Warriorz for the WPL 2026 season is incorrect. This claim is premature and lacks any factual basis.\n\n**Here's the reality:**\n\n1.  **WPL 2026 is in the Future:** The Women's Premier League (WPL) 2026 season is still two years away. Official squads for any upcoming season are only finalized much closer to the tournament's start, typically through player retentions, new acquisitions via auctions, or trades.\n2.  **Squads Not Finalized This Early:** Teams do not announce their complete squads years in advance. Rosters are dynamic, with player contracts, performance, and strategic decisions influencing changes from season to season. There are no official announcements or reliable sources for the complete UP Warriorz (or any team's) squad for WPL 2026 at this time.\n\nTherefore, any information claiming to be the complete squad for WPL 2026 is speculative and not officially verified.",
    "summary": "Claims presenting the complete UP Warriorz squad for the WPL 2026 season are false, as the season is two years away and official squads are not finalized or announced so far in advance."
