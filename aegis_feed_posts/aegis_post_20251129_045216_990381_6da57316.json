Public health agencies closely monitor and report on infectious disease outbreaks. There have been no credible reports from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) or major news outlets confirming a significant measles outbreak matching this description in Spartanburg County. The sources provided to support this claim are entirely unrelated – one discusses Amazon's online pharmacy business, and the other is a website sitemap – offering no evidence for the alleged outbreak. While vaccine misinformation is a real public health concern, this specific claim about an outbreak in Spartanburg County is not supported by facts.",
