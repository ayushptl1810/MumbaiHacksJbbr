    "body": "The claim that the FBI is spending nearly $1 million to redact Jeffrey Epstein's files, specifically flagging 'Trump mentions' for review and limiting public access, is unsubstantiated. There is no credible public reporting or official statement from the FBI confirming such an expenditure or specific redaction criteria. While there is ongoing public and legal interest in the release of Epstein-related documents, and redactions are a standard part of document release processes to protect privacy or ongoing investigations, the highly specific details about the cost and the targeting of 'Trump mentions' lack any verifiable evidence. The sources provided alongside this claim are irrelevant or point to non-existent future articles, further indicating its falsehood.",

The claim alleges specific actions by the FBI, including spending nearly $1 million on redacting Jeffrey Epstein's files, flagging 'Trump mentions,' and potential limitation of public access despite a law. \n2. Source 1 mentions Trump's name appearing in Epstein files and an Attorney General informing him, which partially relates to 'Trump mentions' but not FBI redaction or cost. The date is July 29, 2025.\n3. Source 2 mentions 'Republicans Block Senate Vote to Release Epstein Files,' which could imply limited public access but doesn't mention the FBI, redaction costs, or a specific law mandating release. The date is September 10, 2025.\n4. Source 3 is about James Comey's indictment and is irrelevant to Epstein files or redaction costs. The date is September 28, 2025.\n5. Crucially, all provided sources are dated in the future (2025). This means they cannot serve as factual evidence for a current or past event, thus rendering the claim unverifiable and effectively false based on these 'sources'.",
