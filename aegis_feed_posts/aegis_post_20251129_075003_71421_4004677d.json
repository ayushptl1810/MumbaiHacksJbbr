    "body": "Reports alleging the FBI is spending nearly $1 million in overtime to redact Jeffrey Epstein files, specifically flagging mentions related to Donald Trump, are unsubstantiated. The primary reason for this debunking is that the supposed supporting sources are dated for publication in 2025. Articles from the future cannot serve as evidence for current events or ongoing government operations. While the processing and release of Jeffrey Epstein's files have been a subject of public interest and legal proceedings, these specific details regarding FBI spending and targeted redaction for Trump mentions lack any verifiable, current evidence.",
