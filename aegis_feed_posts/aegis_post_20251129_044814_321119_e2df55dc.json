    "body": "A claim circulating online suggests the FBI spent nearly $1 million to redact Jeffrey Epstein's files and specifically flagged mentions of Donald Trump during this process. Our investigation found this claim to be false. The articles cited as sources for this information are dated in 2025, meaning they are hypothetical or speculative and cannot report on past events. There is no credible evidence from current, verifiable sources to support the assertion that the FBI spent $1 million on such redactions or that specific mentions of Donald Trump were flagged in this context. Misinformation often uses future-dated or irrelevant sources to create a false sense of legitimacy, making it crucial to verify information against current and authoritative sources.",
    "summary": "The claim about the FBI spending $1 million to redact Epstein files and flagging Trump mentions is false, relying on future-dated, non-existent sources.",

Source 1 discusses a review by the 'Justice Department' of Epstein files, but provides no specific monetary figure or attributes the cost to the FBI.\n\nRegarding the second part, Source 1 states, 'Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed Mr. Trump that he was mentioned in the [Epstein files].' This directly supports the assertion that mentions of Donald Trump were present and flagged during the review.\n\nSince the claim is a conjunction ('and'), both parts must be substantiated for the entire claim to be true. As the first part regarding the cost and FBI's specific involvement is not supported by the sources, the overall claim remains uncertain despite the verification of the second part.",
