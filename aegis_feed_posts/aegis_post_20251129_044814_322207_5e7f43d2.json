    "body": "A circulating claim describes an unspecified \"post\" that advocates for deportation and directs users to participate in a poll. Our investigation found this claim to be false. No specific \"post\" matching this description was identified or provided for verification. The sources offered to support this claim are articles from 2025 discussing broader Trump administration policies regarding immigration, asylum, and expediting deportations. These future-dated articles, while relevant to the general topic of deportation policy, *do not mention or describe any specific online post advocating deportation or including a poll* as stated in the claim. Without an actual post to evaluate, and with the provided sources being irrelevant to the existence of such a specific social media interaction, the claim cannot be substantiated.",

        "reasoning": "The claim states that 'The post advocates for deportation and directs users to participate in a poll.'\n\nSources 1 and 2 discuss President Trump's efforts and policies related to speeding up deportations and denying asylum, indicating that deportation was a key part of his administration's agenda. However, these sources do not refer to 'the post' (implying a specific piece of content from which this claim might originate) or state that 'the post' itself advocates for deportation.\n\nSource 3 mentions 'Public polling is showing decreasing support for Trump's immigration agenda, as Americans wake up to the reality that mass deportation means...' This confirms the existence of public polling related to Trump's immigration agenda. However, it does not state that 'the post' *directs users to participate in a poll*. The phrasing in Source 3 refers to external, public polling results, not an interactive poll embedded within or linked by 'the post' itself for user participation.\n\nTherefore, the specific actions attributed to 'the post' in the claim—both advocating for deportation and actively directing users to participate in a poll—are not substantiated by the provided sources.",
