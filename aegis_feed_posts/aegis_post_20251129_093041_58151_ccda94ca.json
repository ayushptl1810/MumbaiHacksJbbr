    "body": "The claim states that a social media post directly asks individuals who regret supporting Donald Trump to share their experiences. However, our verification process found no evidence to substantiate the existence or specific content of such a post. The sources provided, which discuss topics unrelated to social media posts about political regret (e.g., sexual assault survivors and religious support for Trump), do not offer any information that confirms this claim. Without direct links, screenshots, or credible reports of the alleged social media post, this assertion remains unverified. It's crucial to seek concrete evidence when evaluating claims about specific online content.",
