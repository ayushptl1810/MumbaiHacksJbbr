    "body": "The claim asserting an Israeli raid into the Syrian town of Beit Jinn triggered deadly clashes, killing 13 Syrians and leading to heavy destruction, is unverified. While Israel has conducted military operations in Syria, particularly targeting Iranian-linked assets, there are no credible or widely reported accounts from reliable international news organizations, official Syrian or Israeli statements, or independent monitoring groups detailing an Israeli raid specifically into the town of Beit Jinn that resulted in 13 Syrian deaths and significant destruction as described. Without corroborating evidence from trusted sources, this claim lacks substantiation.",
