While measles cases have seen a rise in various parts of the U.S. and vaccine misinformation is a recognized public health challenge, there are no official reports or credible news outlets confirming a specific measles 'outbreak struggling to be contained' in South Carolina. The provided sources discuss general measles trends in the U.S. or are entirely unrelated, such as 2021 COVID-19 updates for Los Angeles. Without specific alerts from South Carolina health authorities or reputable news confirming such an outbreak, this claim lacks evidence.",

This supports the general concept of rising measles cases, low vaccination uptake, and the impact of misinformation. However, no part of Source 1, Source 2 (about COVID-19), or Source 3 (about COVID-19) makes any mention of 'South Carolina' or a measles outbreak specifically in that state. Since a key geographical detail of the claim is unverified by the sources, the claim as a whole cannot be substantiated as true and is therefore false based on the lack of supporting evidence for this specific detail.",
