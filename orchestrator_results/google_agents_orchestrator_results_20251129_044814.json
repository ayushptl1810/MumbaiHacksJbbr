In response, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened pop-up clinics in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children. However, vaccine uptake has been notably low, with only one person attending a clinic in Boiling Springs on a particular Monday.

      "summary": "Spartanburg County, South Carolina, is battling a measles outbreak with over 50 identified cases since early October. In response, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened pop-up clinics in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children. However, vaccine uptake has been notably low, with only one person attending a clinic in Boiling Springs on a particular Monday. State epidemiologist Linda Bell expressed disappointment over the slow progress and low response from mobile health units, directly linking the lack of public engagement to the 'chilling effect of vaccine misinformation'.",

Source 3 is irrelevant, discussing the arrival of a Christmas tree during her tenure.\n\nWhile there is some support for the sentiment of contrast and her likely preference for a different style, the claim uses very specific, strong descriptive language that is not directly found or attributed in the provided sources, making the claim's exact wording uncertain.",

Source 1 discusses a review by the 'Justice Department' of Epstein files, but provides no specific monetary figure or attributes the cost to the FBI.\n\nRegarding the second part, Source 1 states, 'Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed Mr. Trump that he was mentioned in the [Epstein files].' This directly supports the assertion that mentions of Donald Trump were present and flagged during the review.\n\nSince the claim is a conjunction ('and'), both parts must be substantiated for the entire claim to be true.
