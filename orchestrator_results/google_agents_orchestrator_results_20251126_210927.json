This shows the DOJ arguing for the *validity* of a ban, not seeking to strike one down. While the specific administration isn't named in this snippet, the context is generally about gun rights.\n3. Source 2 (PBS) explicitly states: 'The high court found 6-3 the Trump administration did not follow federal law when it reversed course and banned bump stocks after a gunman...' This indicates the *Trump administration itself implemented a ban* (on bump stocks), which the Supreme Court later *struck down*. This is the opposite of the Trump DOJ filing to strike down a ban on public carrying.\n4. Source 3 (PBS) states: 'The justices ruled 8-1 Friday in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders...' This shows the Supreme Court *upholding* a gun control law, not striking it down. The DOJ's specific involvement in this case is not detailed, but the outcome contradicts the premise of striking down bans.\n5. No source indicates the Trump Department of Justice filed with the Supreme Court to strike down state laws banning the public carrying of firearms. Instead, the evidence points to the Trump administration implementing a ban and the DOJ arguing for the validity of bans in other contexts.",

Source 2 (PBS) explicitly states: 'The high court found 6-3 the Trump administration did not follow federal law when it reversed course and banned bump stocks after a gunman...' This indicates the *Trump administration itself implemented a ban* (on bump stocks), which the Supreme Court later *struck down*. This is the opposite of the Trump DOJ filing to strike down a ban on public carrying.\n4. Source 3 (PBS) states: 'The justices ruled 8-1 Friday in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders...' This shows the Supreme Court *upholding* a gun control law, not striking it down. The DOJ's specific involvement in this case is not detailed, but the outcome contradicts the premise of striking down bans.\n5. No source indicates the Trump Department of Justice filed with the Supreme Court to strike down state laws banning the public carrying of firearms.

Source 1 (PBS) states: 'The Justice Department argues the law is valid when used...' in the context of a ban on gun ownership for people who regularly smoke marijuana. This shows the DOJ arguing for the *validity* of a ban, not seeking to strike one down. While the specific administration isn't named in this snippet, the context is generally about gun rights.\n3. Source 2 (PBS) explicitly states: 'The high court found 6-3 the Trump administration did not follow federal law when it reversed course and banned bump stocks after a gunman...' This indicates the *Trump administration itself implemented a ban* (on bump stocks), which the Supreme Court later *struck down*. This is the opposite of the Trump DOJ filing to strike down a ban on public carrying.\n4. Source 3 (PBS) states: 'The justices ruled 8-1 Friday in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders...' This shows the Supreme Court *upholding* a gun control law, not striking it down. The DOJ's specific involvement in this case is not detailed, but the outcome contradicts the premise of striking down bans.\n5. No source indicates the Trump Department of Justice filed with the Supreme Court to strike down state laws banning the public carrying of firearms. Instead, the evidence points to the Trump administration implementing a ban and the DOJ arguing for the validity of bans in other contexts.",

The Trump administration banned bump stocks (which the Supreme Court later struck down), and the Justice Department, in one instance, argued for the validity of a gun ban. The Supreme Court has also upheld a gun control law. None of the sources suggest the Trump DOJ filed to strike down state laws banning the public carrying of firearms.",
                    "confidence": "high",
                    "reasoning": "1. The claim states: 'The Trump Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed with the Supreme Court to strike down state laws banning the public carrying of firearms.'\n2. Source 1 (PBS) states: 'The Justice Department argues the law is valid when used...' in the context of a ban on gun ownership for people who regularly smoke marijuana. This shows the DOJ arguing for the *validity* of a ban, not seeking to strike one down. While the specific administration isn't named in this snippet, the context is generally about gun rights.\n3. Source 2 (PBS) explicitly states: 'The high court found 6-3 the Trump administration did not follow federal law when it reversed course and banned bump stocks after a gunman...' This indicates the *Trump administration itself implemented a ban* (on bump stocks), which the Supreme Court later *struck down*. This is the opposite of the Trump DOJ filing to strike down a ban on public carrying.\n4. Source 3 (PBS) states: 'The justices ruled 8-1 Friday in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders...' This shows the Supreme Court *upholding* a gun control law, not striking it down. The DOJ's specific involvement in this case is not detailed, but the outcome contradicts the premise of striking down bans.\n5. No source indicates the Trump Department of Justice filed with the Supreme Court to strike down state laws banning the public carrying of firearms. Instead, the evidence points to the Trump administration implementing a ban and the DOJ arguing for the validity of bans in other contexts.",
