The South Carolina Department of Public Health opened pop-up clinics offering free measles vaccines, but attendance has been notably low, with one clinic in Boiling Springs seeing only a single person.

Our verification finds this claim to be unsubstantiated. The verdict is 'uncertain' and 'false,' meaning there is no evidence to support this serious allegation. Crucially, the claim fails to specify *which* flyover is being discussed or its geographical location, making any attempt to verify the repair method impossible. Additionally, the sources provided are entirely irrelevant: one is an opinion piece on an author, and the other is a sports article. Neither offers any information pertinent to infrastructure, engineering, or flyover repairs. Without specific details and credible, relevant sources, this generalized criticism of a flyover repair cannot be confirmed.",
