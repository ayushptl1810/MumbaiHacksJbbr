Hernandez was found guilty of using Honduras' government, military, and police to protect cocaine shipments into the U.S. This pledge has ignited swift outrage across social media, with conservative critics like @RepublicansAgainstTrump calling Trump \"the most lawless president in history,\" and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) highlighting Hernandez's responsibility for \"the deaths of countless American citizens.\"",
