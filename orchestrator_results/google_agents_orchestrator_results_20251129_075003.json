            "summary": "President Donald Trump announced his intention to grant a 'Full and Complete pardon' to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former Honduran president convicted of drug trafficking and serving a 45-year federal sentence for moving massive amounts of cocaine into the U.S. Hernandez was extradited in 2024 and found guilty of conspiring to traffic 400 tons of cocaine, having used Honduras' government, military, and police to protect shipments. This announcement sparked swift backlash, with conservative critics calling Trump 'the most lawless president' and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) highlighting Hernandez's responsibility for 'the deaths of countless American citizens.'",

This project, based in Winchester, Virginia, involved nearly 1,000 agents tasked by Director Kash Patel. Between March 17 and March 22, $851,344 was spent, with agents logging 4,737 hours of overtime from January to July reviewing evidence, including Epstein's 2019 prison death, search warrant execution photos, street surveillance, and aerial footage. The process reportedly includes flagging Trump mentions for review.",

            "summary": "South Carolina's Spartanburg County has been battling a measles outbreak since early October, with over 50 identified cases. In response, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened pop-up clinics offering free measles vaccines. Despite these efforts and officials encouraging vaccination, attendance has been extremely low; only one person showed up at a mobile clinic in Boiling Springs. State epidemiologist Linda Bell described the progress as 'slow,' noting that the health department had 'hoped to see a more robust uptake' from their mobile health units, highlighting the 'chilling effect of vaccine misinformation.'",
