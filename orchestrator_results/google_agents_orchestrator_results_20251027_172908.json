The U.S. House, like other legislative bodies, operates according to a pre-determined and publicly available calendar. This schedule includes both periods when representatives are actively legislating in Washington D.C. (in session) and scheduled recesses, during which members typically return to their districts to meet with constituents and conduct other legislative business.\n\nThese recesses are a normal, planned part of the legislative year, not an unexplained or concerning absence. Information on whether the House is currently in session, in recess, or on a break is always accessible through official government resources, such as the House Clerk's website or the websites of the House Majority and Minority Leaders. Any concerns about their schedule can easily be verified by consulting these official sources.\n\nIt's also important to note that the sources provided to support this claim are not relevant to the operational status of the House. For instance, they discuss unrelated political events and are dated for 2025, which is in the future. Relying on outdated or off-topic information can lead to misunderstandings about how Congress functions. Always consult current, official sources for accurate information on legislative schedules.",

The U.S. House, like other legislative bodies, operates according to a pre-determined and publicly available calendar. This schedule includes both periods when representatives are actively legislating in Washington D.C. (in session) and scheduled recesses, during which members typically return to their districts to meet with constituents and conduct other legislative business.\n\nThese recesses are a normal, planned part of the legislative year, not an unexplained or concerning absence. Information on whether the House is currently in session, in recess, or on a break is always accessible through official government resources, such as the House Clerk's website or the websites of the House Majority and Minority Leaders. Any concerns about their schedule can easily be verified by consulting these official sources.\n\nIt's also important to note that the sources provided to support this claim are not relevant to the operational status of the House. For instance, they discuss unrelated political events and are dated for 2025, which is in the future. Relying on outdated or off-topic information can lead to misunderstandings about how Congress functions. Always consult current, official sources for accurate information on legislative schedules.",

The U.S. House, like other legislative bodies, operates according to a pre-determined and publicly available calendar. This schedule includes both periods when representatives are actively legislating in Washington D.C. (in session) and scheduled recesses, during which members typically return to their districts to meet with constituents and conduct other legislative business.\n\nThese recesses are a normal, planned part of the legislative year, not an unexplained or concerning absence. Information on whether the House is currently in session, in recess, or on a break is always accessible through official government resources, such as the House Clerk's website or the websites of the House Majority and Minority Leaders. Any concerns about their schedule can easily be verified by consulting these official sources.\n\nIt's also important to note that the sources provided to support this claim are not relevant to the operational status of the House. For instance, they discuss unrelated political events and are dated for 2025, which is in the future. Relying on outdated or off-topic information can lead to misunderstandings about how Congress functions. Always consult current, official sources for accurate information on legislative schedules.",
