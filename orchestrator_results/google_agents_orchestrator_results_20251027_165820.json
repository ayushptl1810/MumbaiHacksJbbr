These sessions involve votes, committee meetings, and floor debates on critical issues.

These sessions involve votes, committee meetings, and floor debates on critical issues. Unless a claim specifically refers to a known, publicly announced recess — such as a holiday break or the traditional August district work period — the House is typically convening and conducting its duties.

While Congress observes scheduled recesses and district work periods throughout the year, the House is actively engaged in legislative business during most working weeks.\n\nOfficial congressional calendars, available on the U.S. House of Representatives' website (house.gov) and the House Majority Leader's public schedule, clearly detail when legislative sessions are planned. These sessions involve votes, committee meetings, and floor debates on critical issues. Unless a claim specifically refers to a known, publicly announced recess — such as a holiday break or the traditional August district work period — the House is typically convening and conducting its duties. Therefore, a general statement claiming the House is 'not currently in session' is almost always incorrect, as these breaks are temporary and distinct from its overall operational status.",
