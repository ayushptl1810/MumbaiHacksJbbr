Hernandez was extradited to the U.S. in 2024 and convicted in New York for conspiring to traffic 400 tons of cocaine, using Honduras’ government, military, and police to protect drug shipments, and is serving a 45-year federal sentence.

In response, the Department of Public Health opened pop-up clinics offering free measles vaccines to both adults and children, but the uptake has been significantly low. For example, only one person attended a mobile clinic in Boiling Springs on a Monday afternoon. State epidemiologist Linda Bell acknowledged the \"slow\" progress and expressed disappointment, having hoped for a \"more robust uptake\" at the mobile health units. The post attributes this low vaccination rate and the ongoing outbreak to the \"chilling effect of vaccine misinformation.\"",
