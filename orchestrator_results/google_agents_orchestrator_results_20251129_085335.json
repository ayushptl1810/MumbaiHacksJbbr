Hernandez, extradited to the U.S. in 2024 and convicted in New York, is serving a 45-year federal sentence for conspiring to traffic 400 tons of cocaine into the United States, using Honduras’s government, military, and police to protect shipments. This announcement triggered swift outrage across social media, with critics, including conservative accounts and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), condemning the move and highlighting the severity of Hernandez's crimes, which reportedly include responsibility for the deaths of countless American citizens.",

Approximately 1,000 agents, tasked by FBI Director Kash Patel, worked over 4,737 hours between January and July, incurring $851,344 in overtime between March 17-22, according to a Bloomberg report.

In response, the South Carolina Department of Public Health launched pop-up clinics and mobile vaccine units in early November, offering free measles vaccines. However, turnout has been minimal; for example, only one person attended a clinic in Boiling Springs on a Monday afternoon. State epidemiologist Linda Bell noted the slow progress, indicating that public health officials had hoped for a much higher uptake.
