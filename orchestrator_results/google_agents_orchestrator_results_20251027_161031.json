The footage was taken at Hediprasetyo's own wedding in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2013 – over a decade ago. While the man in the video shares a passing resemblance to Donald Trump, especially from certain angles, careful examination and readily available information confirm his true identity.\n\nMisinformation often spreads through misidentification, and this is a clear example of a video being taken out of context and falsely attributed.

The footage was taken at Hediprasetyo's own wedding in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2013 – over a decade ago. While the man in the video shares a passing resemblance to Donald Trump, especially from certain angles, careful examination and readily available information confirm his true identity.\n\nMisinformation often spreads through misidentification, and this is a clear example of a video being taken out of context and falsely attributed. Therefore, any concerns or questions raised about Donald Trump's health based on this particular video are unfounded, as he is not the person shown. Always verify the source and context of viral content before sharing or drawing conclusions.",

The footage was taken at Hediprasetyo's own wedding in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2013 – over a decade ago. While the man in the video shares a passing resemblance to Donald Trump, especially from certain angles, careful examination and readily available information confirm his true identity.\n\nMisinformation often spreads through misidentification, and this is a clear example of a video being taken out of context and falsely attributed. Therefore, any concerns or questions raised about Donald Trump's health based on this particular video are unfounded, as he is not the person shown. Always verify the source and context of viral content before sharing or drawing conclusions.",
